# docker-ubuntu-ovs
This repository is to create docker image to have openvswitch i.e. OVS running inside ubuntu image.

## Build
Run docker build on this directory

## Run
The openvswitch manager and bridge controller connections are managed via an environment variable, MODE,
which must be passed in when the container is spun up. This MODE may have one of the following four forms:
 * MODE=none - will result in no manager or controller being set
 * MODE=ptcp - except passive manager tcp conntections 
 * MODE=tcp - set the manager and controller IPs to the value of the default route
 * MODE=tcp:10.10.1.1 manager and controller IPs to the IP specified. Generally speaking, you will not need this option

To run the docker image say,
 * sudo docker run -itd --name <docker-instance-name> -e MODE=none --cap-add NET_ADMIN <name_of_your_image>
 * sudo docker run -itd --name <docker-instance-name> -e MODE=tcp:<controller-ip> --cap-add NET_ADMIN <name_of_your_image>

## How to run ovs commands under docker
docker exec <docker-instance-name> ovs-vsctl show
docker exec <docker-instance-name> ovs-vsctl list Open_vSwitch
docker exec <docker-instance-name> ovs-vsctl set O . other_config:local_ip=192.168.56.101
docker exec <docker-instance-name> ovs-ofctl dump-flows -O Openflow13 br-int
